## üìç Overview

react-native-webview-bridge provides effective communication between React and React Native App using react-native-webview. It acts like a message broker and enables message exchange, making applications more interactive and dynamic.

You don't need to implment yourself such as event listener setup, message handling and posting across different application components, react-native-webview-bridge will do it for you.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

Add to your react or react-native project by running the following command:

```
npm i react-native-webview-bridge --save
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```
yarn add react-native-webview-bridge
```

### Usage

**React Application**

Basic usage inside your React component:

```javascript
import { useReactNativeWebViewBridgeForReact } from "@cheeselemon/react-native-webview-bridge";

function MyComponent() {
  const { postMessage } = useReactNativeWebViewBridgeForReact({
    handler: (eventName: string, data: any) => {
      // handle published event from react-native app
    },
  });

  // post message to react-native app
  const handleClick = () => {
    postMessage("eventName", { data: "string or object" });
  };
}
```

Note that when handler is defined, the hook will automatically listen to messages from react-native app and call the handler function with the event name and data. The underlying hook will also automatically add event listener to the window object.

There may be circumstances where you only want to publish events to react-native app and not listen to events from react-native app. In this case, you can omit the handler function:

```javascript
const { postMessage } = useReactNativeWebViewBridgeForReact({});
```

Or if you only want to listen to events from react-native app and not publish events to react-native app, you can omit the postMessage function:

```javascript
useReactNativeWebViewBridgeForReact({
  handler: (eventName: string, data: any) => {
    // handle published event from react-native app
  },
});
```

**React Native Application**

Basic usage inside your React Native component:

```javascript
import WebView from 'react-native-webview';
import { useReactNativeWebViewBridgeForReactNative } from "@cheeselemon/react-native-webview-bridge";

function MyComponent() {
  const webViewRef = useRef<WebView>(null);
  // needs reference to webview for postMessage
  const { postMessage, handleMessage } = useReactNativeWebViewBridgeForReactNative(webviewRef);

  // post message to react app
  const handleClick = () => {
    postMessage("eventName", { data: "string or object" });
  };

  
  return <WebView
    ref={webViewRef}
    onMessage={(event) => {
      // pass event object directly for processing
      handleMessage(event, (eventName: string, data: any) => {
        // handle published event from react app here
      });

      // it is possible to handle other events that are not published by this library.
      const { data } = event.nativeEvent; // do whatever you want
    }}
  />
}

```
